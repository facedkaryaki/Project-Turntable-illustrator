# Project-Turntable-illustrator
Another game-changer from Adobe: the AI feature Project Turntable for Illustrator has been released â€” AI transforms a vector 2D image into a full-fledged 3D model.

All the neural magic happens at the push of a button, with models generated while preserving style and quality, without artifacts or perspective distortions.

A must-have for designers is currently being actively tested, and we're waiting for the release, but in the meantime, we're enjoying the fresh leak!
